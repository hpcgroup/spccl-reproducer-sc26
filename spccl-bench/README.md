# SpCCL / NCCLX /SparCML Benchmarking Harness

This is a snapshot of the microbenchmarking harness used to evaluate
SpCCL, NCCLX, and SparCML. On Perlmutter, the following will build
the binaries necessary for experiment reproduction. SpCCL, NCCLX,
and nccl-tests should be built first (instructions in sibling directories
`torchcomms-sparse`, `torchcomms-baseline`, and `nccl-tests`). Building
all harnesses here should take <5 minutes.

```
source modules.sh
bash build.sh
```

Make sure to `module load nccl/2.24.3` before running
benchmarks on a compute node. Slurm submission scripts
are present under `sbatch_*` directories. Results
are emitted to CSV files under
`results/{rs|ar|ag}`. These scripts can be submitted
via `sbatch`, for example:
`sbatch sbatch_rs_full_sweep_final/rs_batch_16_adaptive_spop_fp32.sh`.
The account name (after `#SBATCH --account` in the scripts) will need
to be changed to an account the user has access to.

Data to reproduce Figure 2 in the paper (reduce-scatter threshold sweep) can be
obtained by running `sbatch_rs_threshold_sweep_final/rs_batch_16_adaptive_spop_fp32.sh`.

Data to reproduce Figure 4 in the paper (all-gather channel sweep) can be obtained by running
`sbatch_ag_channel_sweep_final/ag_batch_16_sparse_spop_fp32.sh`

Main microbenchmark results (Figures 5-9) can be reproduced by submitting
all batch scripts under: `sbatch_{ar|ag|rs}_full_sweep_final`. These scripts
also produce the data necessary to reproduce Figure 3 (Pici vs COO in SpCCL).
For Figure 9 (all-reduce), SparCML results are included. Thus, scripts under
`sbatch_sparcml_sweep_final` also must be run.

# Results Interpretation

## CSV Field Reference

Each batch script writes two CSV files under `results/{rs|ar|ag}/`:
a CCD/NCCLX results file (`<coll>_<ngpus>_<jobid>.csv`) and a
nccl-tests baseline file (`<coll>_nccl_<ngpus>_<jobid>.csv`). The
schemas differ. The meaning of fields relevant to reproduction
are enumerated below.

### CCD / NCCLX CSV (`<coll>_<ngpus>_<jobid>.csv`)

**Run identification**
- `jobid` — SLURM job ID
- `tag` — sweep label set in the batch script (e.g. `rs_full_sweep_final`)
- `method` — implementation/format used (`nccl_dense` for NCCLX, `nccl_sparse` for SpCCL)
    - For SparCML runs, this will be one of: `sparcml_recdoubling`, `sparcml_big`, `sparcml_small`, `sparcml_ring`
- `dtype` — element type (`fp32`)
- `n_gpus` — total GPUs in the run

**Workload**
- `N`, `M` — tensor dimensions; total elements `C = N*M`
- `val_bytes` — bytes per value (4 for fp32, 2 for fp16)
- `dense_bytes` — total dense tensor size (`C * val_bytes`)
- `sparsity_pct` — target sparsity in percent (0 = dense, 99 = 99% zeros)
- `uniform_sparsity` — `1` if every rank has identicaly sparsity patterns; `0` if sparsity is randomized per rank

**NCCL/NCCLX configuration**
- `n_channels` — value of `NCCL_MIN/MAX_NCHANNELS` for the run (`0` if unset). These are set to the same value in
microbenchmarks to fix a channel count.
- `nccl_ccd_format_mask` — value of `NCCL_CCD_FORMAT_MASK` (1=dense-only, 2=COO non-adaptive, 3=COO adaptive, 4=SPOP/Pici non-adaptive, 5=SPOP/Pici adaptive). "Adaptive" means that the collective may swap data to a dense format during collective execution (relevant to reduce-scatter and all-reduce).
- `dense_threshold` — `NCCL_CCD_DENSE_THRESHOLD` (inter-node sparsity threshold above which the sparse path is used)
- `dense_intra_threshold` — `NCCL_CCD_DENSE_INTRA_THRESHOLD` (intra-node sparsity threshold)
- `ag_dense_threshold` — `NCCL_CCD_AG_DENSE_THRESHOLD` (sparsity threshold for the all-gather phase of RS+AG all-reduce)

**Timing** (all in milliseconds, averaged over `iterations` after `warmups`)

Four timing variants are reported as `{avg_time,max_time,min_time}` reduced across ranks. `avg_time_barrier_no_memcpy` is the timer used in paper plots. It includes a timed barrier after the collective invocation.

**Iteration counts**
- `iterations`, `warmups` — number of timed iterations and discarded warmups

**Validation**
- `correct` — `1` if the GPU result matches the CPU MPI reference checks.

### nccl-tests CSV (`<coll>_nccl_<ngpus>_<jobid>.csv`)

Parsed from nccl-tests stdout, one row per `(message_size, blocking_mode)`:

- `jobid`, `tag`, `n_gpus`, `dtype` — same meaning as above
- `collective` — `ag`, `rs`, or `ar`
- `n_channels` — `NCCL_MIN/MAX_NCHANNELS` value (`0` if unset)
- `blocking` — `1` for blocking API (`-z 1`), `0` for nonblocking
- `message_size_mib` — message size in MiB
- `time_us_oop`, — out-of-place execution time (μs), which is the timer used for NCCL results in the paper

`busbw` (bus bandwidth) is the metric to compare across GPU counts; it normalizes for collective topology (see nccl-tests documentation for the per-collective formula).
